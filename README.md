# Module-4-Challenge

For the module 4 challenge, I was tasked to create a quiz that times the user and if they answer incorrectly, they lose seconds off their timer. I created a multiple choice coding quiz with three basic questions about coding and if the user answers correctly, they move on to the next question. If they answer wrong, they still move on but lose 10 seconds off their timer. They also get to add their initials at the end and submit it so it's saved for later on. I added a light blue indicator for the user whenever they select an answer so they know which is selected. I actually didn't have this when I finished. It was just blank with no color but then I told myself it needed one because what if the user gets confused and doesn't know which answer they clicked on. Website design is pretty basic. I know it needs more color and design but I wasn't sure if that was needed or not so I left it out. At the end of the quiz, you will also find out your score. 


Code source is from me but I had some help from a professor on getting the pages to move from one to the other. It was difficult but I made it work. I unfortunately couldn't get the initials and score to appear in local storage for some reason. Maybe I was doing something wrong but I will ask my Professor what he thinks was the issue next class. Location of the code is on the main branch of the repository. For the css code, it's in the folder "css" and the javascript code is in the "js" folder.
